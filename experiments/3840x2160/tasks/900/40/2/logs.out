     | The CPI may be too high. This could be caused by issues such as memory
     | stalls, instruction starvation, branch misprediction or long latency
     | instructions. Explore the other hardware-related metrics to identify what
     | is causing high CPI.

Memory Bound: 28.0% of Pipeline Slots
 | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant fraction of
 | execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load and
 | stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric breakdown by memory
 | hierarchy, memory bandwidth information, correlation by memory objects.
