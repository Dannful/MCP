     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor utilization of logical
     | CPU cores while the utilization of physical cores is acceptable. Consider
     | using logical cores, which in some cases can improve processor throughput
     | and overall performance of multi-threaded applications.

Memory Bound: 38.0% of Pipeline Slots
 | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant fraction of
 | execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load and
 | stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric breakdown by memory
 | hierarchy, memory bandwidth information, correlation by memory objects.
