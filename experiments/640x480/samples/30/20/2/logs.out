    CPI Rate: 3.354
     | The CPI may be too high. This could be caused by issues such as memory
     | stalls, instruction starvation, branch misprediction or long latency
     | instructions. Explore the other hardware-related metrics to identify what
     | is causing high CPI.

    Average CPU Frequency: 2.596 GHz 
    Total Thread Count: 20
Effective Physical Core Utilization: 92.2% (18.449 out of 20)
    Effective Logical Core Utilization: 48.1% (19.238 out of 40)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor utilization of logical
     | CPU cores while the utilization of physical cores is acceptable. Consider
     | using logical cores, which in some cases can improve processor throughput
     | and overall performance of multi-threaded applications.

Memory Bound: 56.4% of Pipeline Slots
 | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant fraction of
 | execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load and
 | stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric breakdown by memory
 | hierarchy, memory bandwidth information, correlation by memory objects.
 |
    Cache Bound: 33.6% of Clockticks
     | A significant proportion of cycles are being spent on data fetches from
     | caches. Check Memory Access analysis to see if accesses to L2 or L3
     | caches are problematic and consider applying the same performance tuning
     | as you would for a cache-missing workload. This may include reducing the
     | data working set size, improving data access locality, blocking or
     | partitioning the working set to fit in the lower cache levels, or
     | exploiting hardware prefetchers. Consider using software prefetchers, but
     | note that they can interfere with normal loads, increase latency, and
     | increase pressure on the memory system. This metric includes coherence
     | penalties for shared data. Check Microarchitecture Exploration analysis
     | to see if contested accesses or data sharing are indicated as likely
     | issues.
